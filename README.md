# ketbeats
ketbeats.io will be a website for music distribution. At this stage of the project we will distribute the instrumental music, that I and @emlcrstf ( steemit.com acc) are creating under the moniker KET! Beats. If we manage to create a good enviorment for other music producers or songwriters ketbeats.io will evolve in an open source platform. 
I would also love to explore the option of creating this website based on the blockchain technology. Maybe it can be connected to the steem block or it will have a block on its own.
